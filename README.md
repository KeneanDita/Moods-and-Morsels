# Amazon Food Review Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on a subset of the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset. The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**, helping businesses and researchers gain insights into customer satisfaction through natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The original dataset contained **over 565,000 reviews**, but due to resource constraints and to accelerate model prototyping, it was **reduced to 10,000 records** for this project.
